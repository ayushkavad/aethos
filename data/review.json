What I appreciate most about these courses is that they are not just about memorizing vocabulary or grammar rules but about changing your approach to learning a language. It's clear that he cares about our progress and success. His heart is in teaching, and he approaches it with the mind of a psychologist. Not only is he incredibly knowledgeable about the English language and its nuances, but he also has a really nice personality and sense of humor. Taking his courses feels like going on a journey of discovery and learning how to enjoy the process of learning English. It's like having a friend who is an experienced traveler and who supports and encourages you throughout the journey. You want to travel with him again and again. I highly recommend his courses to anyone looking for a truly transformative learning experience.",

I learned a ton from this course and really came out much more confident. Jose seems to have a lot a really good courses on Udemy. My only gripe is, he doesnâ€™t seem to update them. There are a few new features in Python as of 2023 that I feel would be pertinent to be aware of but this course is still relevant. However, some of his other courses are a little out of date. He teaches you how to download and use the versions of material he is using which is cool, but I think he should add updates.",
